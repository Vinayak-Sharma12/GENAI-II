        "--> Basically RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter is the smarter version of CharacterTextsplitter. In Both the Cases there is one case we always need to follow that is the size of our chunk should always be less than the chunk_size.In case of CharacterTextSplitter the spliting of text first happened according to the separator(if separator not mention then by default is paragraph) and then the splited text is combined until it doesn't exceed the chunk_size\n",
        "\n",
        "Now In case of RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter,Spliting of text happends paragraphs,sentence,words,character first it tries to split it into paragraphs if paragraphs doesn't exceed the chunk_size then they are tried to combine and if they don't exceed they are converted into chunks by combining else individually.\n",
        "\n",
        "Suppose Paragraphs exceeds the chunk_size then we try do so using sentence and try to combine sentence and convert it into chunks if it doesn't exceed chunk_size else chunks individually\n",
